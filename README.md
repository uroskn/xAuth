# xAuth fork
--

This is a xauth fork used on our minecraft server https://minecraft.knuples.net/

It will probably not work on your server as it interacts with some internal scripts
that are not published. 

Also our maintenance policy is: If it doesn't work and we don't need it, rip it out.

Sry.
